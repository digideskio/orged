## Setup

You need a `.env` file at the top of the repo that looks like:

TRELLO_DEVELOPER_PUBLIC_KEY=pub_key_for_orged_user
TRELLO_MEMBER_TOKEN=member_token_for_orged_user
TRELLO_USER_ID=user_id_of_orged_user

Where your_pub_key has been generated by visiting
https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate

And member_token has been generated by visiting:

https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=PUB_KEY_FOR_ORGED_USER&response_type=token&expiration=never&scope=read,write


## How this works

There is a distinguished board 'Position Experiment'. It is the summary of current work / scheduling it. All other boards that the orged user is a member of are the project boards. Cards in 'Top 3' or 'Done' lists from the project boards get synced into the summary board, where 'Done' ones get a done label (green). Any cards manually added to the summary board are not touched.

Currently marking cards as done on the summary board is not supported. They should be moved to the Done column in the project board (to some extent, this is a safety thing - orged doesn't currently make modifications to any board except the summary board, which it more-or-less owns).
